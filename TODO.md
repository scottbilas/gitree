* Mark modification/rename/etc state, just like lazygit does
  Right now there's no way to know if a file has staged bits (or fully staged) or not
* Add git state icons like ranger
* Mark submodules like ranger
  * Consider descending into submodule to get further summary or recursive status
* Improve perf, holy eff..maybe rewrite in python or rust..?
* Show split, with filenames in second aligned column
* --dirsfirst

* Research "ls" extension that shows git status
